## Why?

When [SUT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_under_test) is behind a firewall, load engines runniong in cloud locations are unable to reach it.

Crane is a solution to this problem:

- Installed *behind* firewall
- Receives instructions from BZA by **polling**
- No inbound traffic
- Docker, Kubernetes, Native [(pymage](https://github.com/Blazemeter/bzm-crane/blob/master/pymage.md))
