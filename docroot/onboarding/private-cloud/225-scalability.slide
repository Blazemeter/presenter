## Scalability

- Concurrency management or why I do not scale
    - Local file [locking](https://github.com/Blazemeter/private-cloud/blob/master/bzm_app/mapping.py#L96) to not lose secrets on single node
        - Reads mapping `M={S1}` adds secret S2: `M={S1,S2}`
        - Other node does same `M`={S1}` => `M'={S1,S2'}`
        - Whichever node writes, `S2` or `S2'` is **lost**!
    - Fine-grained "namespaces" reduces chances of this, less APIs need to write to same mapping
